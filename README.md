#About SIR Model

It is divided into 3 compartment:
Susceptible
Infectious
Recovered

Susceptible is a group of people who are vulnerable to exposure with infectious people

The group of infectious represents the infected people. They can pass the disease to susceptible people and can be recovered in a specific period.

Recovered people get immunity so that they are not susceptible to the same illness anymore
